'''
Welcome to your first lab! Each lab starts with a multiline
string, like this.  (That's what the triple quotes mean.)

Embedded in this multiline string will be what looks like copy-pastes
from interactive Python prompts:

>>> hello("world")
'Hello, world!'

That is actually an automated test. Your job is to write code to make
it pass. In other words, you must define a function named "hello" that
takes one argument, and returns the greeting. You do that below,
where it says "Write your code here".

Here's another test, which gives an important distinction:
>>> print_hello("world")
Hello, world!

Notice the output has no quotes around it? That means the function
printed, rather than returning a string.

Pro tips:

 * ONLY write code in the area below. Don't modify this multiline
   string!

 * When you run the script and see multiple failures, focus on fixing
  the first failure. Often later failures will then go away.

# Write your code here:



# Do not edit any code below this line!

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import doctest
    count, _ = doctest.testmod()
    if count == 0:
        print('*** ALL TESTS PASS ***\nGive someone a HIGH FIVE!')
